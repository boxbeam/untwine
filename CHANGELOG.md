## 0.9.3
- Add `repeat` attribute, which accepts both `usize` and ranges, and matches a pattern within that range or exactly that number of times

## 0.9.2
- Implement `Deref` and `DerefMut` for `Span`
- Add attribute `map` and alias `convert`, which can be used like `#[map(map_fn)] pattern` to convert the output type of a parser
  - Previously you would have to write a new named parser just to convert the output of another parser

## 0.9.1
- Fix compiler error in empty match statement when error type is specified
- Disable unreachable_code lint inside generated code, as it could be generated by empty match statements

## 0.9.0
- Add support for match-type parsers (https://github.com/boxbeam/untwine/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md#using-matches)
  - This allows much more concise and intuitive representations for parsers which have many different structures evaluating to the same type
- Make delimited lists less greedy
  - Previously, if a delimiter was found when parsing a delimited list, it would attempt to parse another element and error if it fails
  - Delimited lists will now consider parsing successful and return what was parsed if there is no element following the delimiter
  - This is useful for structures which allow optional (or required) trailing delimiters, such as `1,2,3,`
  - The above can now be expressed like `num$","+ ","?` instead of `num ("," num)* ","?`
    - This also allows you to get a `Vec<T>` instead of a `(T, Vec<T>)`
- Add `#[span]` decorator, which allows you to capture the portion of input corresponding to a parsed value
- Update examples to reflect new ideal implementations of JSON and boolean expression parsers

## 0.8.3
- Fix improper error reporting with lookahead optimization
  - Could sometimes cause panics due to the start position of an error being ahead of the end position, causing an overflow in display code
- Disable elided_named_lifetimes warning inside parser blocks

## 0.8.2

- Make all non-captured parsers use `.ignore()` to drop their outputs
  - This makes it possible to do things such as `#(a | b)` where `a` and `b` have different types. Since the overall output is ignored, both their outputs will be ignored and the parsers do not have to have the same output type.
- Add character literals like `'"'`

## 0.8.1

- Fix issue with incomplete parses sometimes not generating any errors
- Write tutorial

## 0.8.0

- Fix some strange error messages
- Make AppendCell crate-private

## 0.7.0 

- Overhaul of error handling internals
- ~20% improvement in parser performance

## 0.6.1

- Improve errors for missing delimiters
- Add some missing documentation

## 0.6.0

- Implement automatic error recovery
  - Enabled with `recover = true` in your parser's configuration block
  - Automatically recovers to the delimiters of delimited lists and of wrapped named rules
    - Wrapped named rules like `parens: "(" parens* ")" -> MyType { ... }`
- Remove all runtime dependencies

## 0.5.0

- Implement lookahead optimization
  - Automatically generates a match statement at compiletime for choice patterns
  - Looks ahead by one character only
  - ~25% improvement in parser performance

## 0.4.0

- Add tests
- Improve docs

## 0.3.0

- Add parser_repl function for easy testing of a simple parser
  - Only intended for debugging, very minimal REPL without scrolling

## 0.2.0

- Prettier, more informative errors
- Error ranges, which point out an error's origin / context as well
- Implementation of proof of concept parsers
- Initial working release
